## Group:

## Dataset:

Yahoo Finance Module(yfinance)

-Ajusted close and added the Daily Return using the pandas percent change method.

## Packages:

matplotlib,

seaborn,

yfiance


How we defined manufacturer market segment:
  - We used the median base price across all us models for each manufacturer.


## Goals of the Analysis:

The Goal of the analysis is to find out the best performing auto stock that overcame the covid pandemic and will have the best potential in the next 30 days. We will look at daily return rates using the adjusted close over the last year to see how the stocks performed pre and post covid as well as predict the next 30 days using a predicting simulation called Monte Carlo Simulation. We will focus on Risk and Expected Returns, and moving averages to determine the best stock that has performed the best thus far in 2020.

##Conclusion:

### Was there any correlation between based on manufacturer region or market segmentation.

All stocks in the review sample had a pandemic sell-off with losses of between 25% and 60% across the different regions. 
The US region had the greatest falls in value (> 50%) for all stocks however all except Ford were able to recover these losses and perform better than their pre-pandemic sell-off price. Tesla had the greatest growth in value to end the period > 400% up, Ford had the worst perfomance to end the period more or less flat.
Non-US manufacturer also faced the pandemic sell-off but European Manufacturers had an average 30% drop versus an average 25% drop from their Asian counterparts. Both regions while performing better during the sell-off have had different outcomes post the sell-off with Europe having better recovery and an average price growth of 30% compared to only 15% for Asia.

Looking at the distribution of daily returns across the regions; US firms performed better on average showing growth or breaking even, Asian firms underperformed in comparision to the broader group and European firms ended up even.
US firms prices showed broader variability compared to Asian and European firms.

### Best stock to choose for a 30 day return:

Based on our model we predict that chrysler will have the highest return over the next 30 days.
